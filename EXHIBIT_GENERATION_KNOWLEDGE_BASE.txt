Between major sections or criteria, use separator pages for clarity

### 6. **Maintain Professional Formatting**
- Consistent fonts (Times New Roman 12pt or Arial 11pt)
- 1-inch margins
- Single or 1.15 line spacing
- Black text on white background

### 7. **Quality Over Quantity**
Focus on strong, relevant evidence rather than padding with weak materials

### 8. **Cross-Reference**
In the brief, reference specific exhibit letters/numbers when citing evidence

### 9. **Translations**
All non-English documents must include certified translations with translator credentials

### 10. **Final Package Check**

## 📞 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Questions:

**Q: What if I don't have evidence for all criteria?**

**Q: Can I combine multiple pieces of evidence into one exhibit?**
A: Yes, especially for criterion-based organization. Example: "Exhibit F: Media Coverage (Articles 1-15)"

**Q: Should the brief be early or late in the package?**
A: Attorney preference varies. Common positions: Exhibit A/B (early) or after personal docs but before criterion evidence.

**Q: How many expert letters do I need?**
A: Quality over quantity. 3-5 strong independent expert letters better than 10 weak ones.

**Q: Can I use social media as evidence?**
A: Yes, if archived and part of demonstrating media coverage or public recognition. Must be credible sources.
