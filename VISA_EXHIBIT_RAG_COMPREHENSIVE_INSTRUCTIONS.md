## SECTION 5: P-1A INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ATHLETES

### 5.1 P-1A Standard Criteria (8 CFR § 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B))

Beneficiary must demonstrate **2 of 7 criteria**:

| Criterion | Code | Description | Primary Evidence Types |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **(1)** | P1A-1 | Significant Participation in Prior Season with Major U.S. Sports League | Team contracts, roster documentation, league qualification (6+ teams, $10M+ revenue) |
| **(2)** | P1A-2 | Participation with National Team in International Competition | National team selection, competition records, federation documentation |
| **(3)** | P1A-3 | Significant Participation in U.S. Intercollegiate Competition | NCAA/collegiate records, athletic scholarship documentation |

| **(6)** | P1A-6 | International Ranking | Official ranking documentation, ranking organization credibility |
| **(7)** | P1A-7 | Significant Honors or Awards | Award certificates, award significance, selection criteria |

### 5.2 P-1A CRITICAL RULES

⚠️ **NO COMPARABLE EVIDENCE PROVISION FOR P-1A**

The P-1A visa category has **NO** regulatory provision for comparable evidence. 

**Regulatory Limitation:** 8 CFR § 214.2(p)(4)(ii)(B) does not include a comparable evidence provision equivalent to 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(v).

**Implications:**
- All P-1A petitions MUST satisfy at least 2 of the 7 standard criteria exactly as written
- There is NO flexibility to substitute alternative evidence types
- Creative presentation within existing criteria is allowed, but substitution is NOT
- Athletes in non-traditional sports must still meet standard criteria

⚠️ **NO MAJOR AWARD PATH FOR P-1A**

Unlike O-1A, O-1B, and EB-1A, P-1A does **NOT** have a "major award" automatic qualification path.

⚠️ **MANDATORY ITINERARY REQUIREMENT**

All P-1A petitions MUST include a detailed itinerary per 8 CFR § 214.2(p)(2)(iv)(A).

**Itinerary Must Include:**
- Specific dates for each competition/event
- Locations and venues
- Event names and types
- Contracts/invitations for each event
